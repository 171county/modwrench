# Roadmap

Where ModWrench is going next, so an issue or a pull request can be checked against it.
These are plans, not promises: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) says what has shipped, and
[TRUST.md](TRUST.md) says what each tool does today. If something here is wrong or you'd
order it differently, [open an issue](https://github.com/171county/modwrench/issues).

## Before 0.3.0 is released

The code is on `main`, and none of it is on npm yet. Two checks it hasn't had:

- **A real game install.** Nothing has run against a real Skyrim Special Edition or
  Fallout 4 folder; the tests build their own.
- **Real clients.** The pages have been drawn only in a stand-in for an MCP Apps host. Each
  one should be opened in the clients that support MCP Apps, with the results written into
  TRUST.md.

## After 0.3.0

- **More of LOOT's masterlist.** The conflict check reads only the masterlist's
  incompatibility entries (`inc`). The same file also carries LOOT's messages for a plugin,
  with the conditions they apply under, the dirty-plugin records (`dirty`) and the load-order
  rules (`after`, `req`). The plan is to read them from the file ModWrench already fetches,
  read-only, and to evaluate a condition only when ModWrench supports every function in it,
  skipping the message otherwise.
- **The pages:** mod names cut at 120 characters, the load-order page titled
  "Dependencies", plugin names cut off at phone width, and download counts that show "—".

## Open questions

- **How ModWrench reaches Nexus Mods.** Whether the read tools can move to Nexus's v2
  GraphQL API, so that no personal API key is needed, and whether endorsing a mod goes
  through OAuth as a registered application. This is being worked out with Nexus Mods
  support.
- **ChatGPT.** Whether the local tools work in ChatGPT's desktop app and Codex hasn't been
  tested, so the README doesn't list them.
